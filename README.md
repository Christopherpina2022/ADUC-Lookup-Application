# ALA Windows Presentation Foundation build
This is the same application as the ALA, but built with WPF instead of WinForms, i'm mainly doing this to learn how to implement WPF. if you want the original, you can find
it on the main branch.

## Resource Dictionary
I found that I can make a WPF form use a similar form of a CSS file by just making a resource dictionary from a seperate file and then calling it in App.xaml
which should apply the styles once i get them setup correctly. This can make it so I don't have to define positioning, size, and alignment every single time.
